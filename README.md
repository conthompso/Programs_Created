# Programs_Created

The LED_Waveform_Lights is an arduino code that I created for a gift that I was going to give to a friend that 
required me to test my coding abilities. This was the first type of coding project that I undertook and is more of a fun
project rather than something I was required to do.


The WebStringerv1 file is a c++ file that I created during my senior year course for aerospace structures. The assignment was
to basically come up with the shear stresses and axial forces that a stringer on a wing experiences due to the geometry, lift, 
and drag. The multicell web-stringer analysis basically required location of stringers in an X-Y space and the areas of the stringer
cross-section, however, my group was not able to find lots of data on the stringer locations, so instead, I created a variable code
that could take in a variable number of stringers as well as a variable amount of cells. This helped the tail-end amount of work
because we didnt need to calculate those values and could just use the code to find the numbers.
