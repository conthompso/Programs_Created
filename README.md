# Programs_Created

The LED_Waveform_Lights is an arduino code that I created for a gift that I was going to give to a friend that 
required me to test my coding abilities. This was the first type of coding project that I undertook and is more of a fun
project rather than something I was required to do.


The WebStringerv1 file is a c++ file that I created during my senior year course for aerospace structures. The assignment was
to basically come up with the shear stresses and axial forces that a stringer on a wing experiences due to the geometry, lift, 
and drag. The multicell web-stringer analysis basically required location of stringers in an X-Y space and the areas of the stringer
cross-section, however, my group was not able to find lots of data on the stringer locations, so instead, I created a variable code
that could take in a variable number of stringers as well as a variable amount of cells. This helped the tail-end amount of work
because we didnt need to calculate those values and could just use the code to find the numbers. 

Scaffolding callouts is an arbitrary Python script that I created to solve a problem at work. The program basically takes a photo input and 
allows the user to draw boxes in multiple colors using left click to locate the . The pixels location of the coords of the boxes are 
stored as vectors and has a feature that allows the user to delete drawn boxes by right clicking and updating the program. The vectors 
of the coords are also stored in a txt file which allows the loading of previous entries and manipulation of the previous entries in 
subsequent launches of the program. There is another feature that allows the user to zoom in on the image, draw a box in the zoomed in 
image, zoom back out, and have the coords in the image adjust to account for the zoom. The zoomed in coords are converted to normal and
stored in the same vector as the other boxes.
